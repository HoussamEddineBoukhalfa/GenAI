# ArabMedicalGPT

## Overview
ArabMedicalGPT is an Arabic advanced language model for medical applications, leveraging the powerful capabilities of GEMINI. This project aims to improve healthcare outcomes by providing more accurate and efficient medical language processing for diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care.

## Features
- **Medical Language Understanding**: Enhanced comprehension of medical terminology.
- **Treatment Recommendation**: AI-driven suggestions for treatments based on patient history and current medical standards.
- **Question Answering**: Instant responses to medical queries, supporting both healthcare professionals and patients.

## Techstack Used:
- Python
- LangChain
- GEMINI
- Pinecone
- Django
- React

## RAG Architecture
In this project, I implemented the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, which enhances the model's ability to retrieve relevant documents and generate accurate, context-aware responses. This architecture is particularly useful in handling complex medical queries by providing precise information based on a vast knowledge base.
