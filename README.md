# ArabMedicalGPT

## Overview
ArabMedicalGPT is an Arabic advanced language model for medical applications, leveraging the powerful capabilities of GEMINI. This project aims to improve healthcare outcomes by providing more accurate and efficient medical language processing for diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and patient care.

- LangChain
- GEMINI
- Pinecone
- Django
- React

## RAG Architecture
In this project, I implemented the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, which enhances the model's ability to retrieve relevant documents and generate accurate, context-aware responses. This architecture is particularly useful in handling complex medical queries by providing precise information based on a vast knowledge base.
